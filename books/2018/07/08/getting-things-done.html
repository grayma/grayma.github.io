    <p>I’m pretty jaded against a lot having to do with modern corporations, so reading <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> made me roll my eyes quite a few times, but damn, am I glad I read through this book. I genuinely think the ideas laid out by Allen, especially because of how clearly he worded them, will significantly change my life for the better by making thoughts about productivity that have flickered through my mind into concrete ideas. I’m not going to give an in-depth review or anything like that, but I will list some of the key take-aways that I found useful from the book. In order, I list the important concepts I gathered from the book that everyone could use (not everything obviously), more points I really enjoyed reading about, and also some ideas I had about my own productivity systems along the way.</p>

<p>In short, this post can’t convey how helpful this book is. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in working better.</p>

<p>Primary points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Capture EVERYTHING in your head and life into a system that you trust and check frequently</li>
  <li>Break down projects into actionable items</li>
  <li>Differentiate between actions that you do, actions you need others to do, reference materials, and someday desires</li>
  <li>Do one big initial collection to get everything into the system and organized/delegated</li>
  <li>Smaller weekly reviews going forward</li>
  <li>Do your action items when possible (depending on context/time available/energy available), always if they take less than 2 to 5 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>Other/what I enjoyed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t let urgent distract from important</li>
  <li>Maybe write down always what is on the mind on a pad to keep track of what is being worked on and what flies in</li>
  <li>Have a next physical action always at the ready for every project</li>
  <li>Mind like water, nothing on mind except present moment. Achieve by giving every nagging thought a next action/project</li>
  <li>If you’re not sure about something or what it is it will be overwhelming</li>
  <li>Anxiety doesn’t come from too much to do (always will be) comes from breaking/worrying about breaking commitments you make with yourself</li>
  <li>People around you adopting it will make the system better</li>
  <li>Danger comes when complacent about capturing/triaging/next action-ing</li>
  <li>Induction applies to life, it’s not about what comes ultimately, it’s about the start and how to make each next step</li>
  <li>Mind is for having ideas and being creative, not remembering them (how does this reconcile with memorization?)</li>
  <li>Use a tool/prodcutivity system you enjoy playing with</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideas I had for my own systems I use at the moment (Google Keep, iOS Calendar, iOS Reminders):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use google keep for primary triage ground</li>
  <li>Pin action item lists</li>
  <li>Non action item lists not pinned but color coded</li>
  <li>A few lists ready to dump into unpinned or pinned if urgent to organize</li>
  <li>Reference folder on desktop for better long-term organization so as not to crowd Google Keep</li>
  <li>Calendar for everything time-based</li>
  <li>Reminders for actions needing to be taken really soon</li>
  <li>Folder in desk for paper stuff (scan what can be scanned into reference)</li>
</ul>
