    <p>Capturing a forgotten feeling, a wonderful one in particular, is truly amazing. That best describes how I felt after reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One">Ready Player One</a> by Ernest Cline. I haven’t felt so engaged in a written story in a <em>very</em> long time. As said in a <a href="http://mattgray.net/books/2018/07/08/the-pearl.html">previous post</a>, since I started reading more in school I progressively read less and less at home, even for pleasure. This book is the first large fiction piece that I completely sank into and flew through (even <a href="http://mattgray.net/books/2017/07/03/earth-abides.html">Earth Abides</a>, one of my favorite books, took me forever to get through - multiple attempts at picking up the book over the course of a year if I remember correctly).</p>

<p>As far as the quality of the book goes, it was phenomenal. A lot of books written for and from the perspective of teenagers can use cringe-inducing language. This book didn’t. The characters were well written and relatable - realistic is a good descriptor. I would recommend it to almost anyone as long as they have some knowledge or interest in technology. Long story short, it was a fun, light, and enjoyable read. For anyone struggling to get through books like they used to, pick up something like Ready Player One, or another really enjoyable and easy read, to get you back into the swing of things :).</p>
