    <p>I suck at forming habits - things that mostly only benefit in the long-term, but have to be done in the short-term. I wanted something to help me do this, but nothing on the App Store really did exactly what I wanted as easily as I thought it could be done. That’s why I made Streaking. It’s a damn simple application that allows you to add a habit you want to form and track it over time - that’s it. Everyday it will nudge you to do your habits for the day (drink more water, floss, do 5 minutes of stretching), and you can swipe to complete them and build up a streak. That’s pretty much it. Over time the application will locally track some simple statistics about each habit to show you - how many times you do something per day, on average how often you complete the habit, etc.</p>

<p>The start of this application was me wanting to be better at a few small daily things, the main one was “Reading 1pg/day” and over the past month I actually have solidified this habit in my life - something I have been wanting to do more often since high school but I just hadn’t nailed down yet.</p>

<p>Another reason is I want to be transparent with the process of making this app. I put a lot of love into it and I want to continue to do so because it helps me be a better person everyday. If you think this app could be made better in any way, please feel free to let me know and I would love to try and add support for your idea into the application. Some things I am thinking of adding, but weren’t important for the initial version are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Going back to previous days to complete habits that you just didn’t mark-off yet</li>
  <li>A better view for statistics</li>
  <li>A dark mode</li>
  <li>Apple Watch support</li>
  <li>and more</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the link to the application, let me know what you think!</p>
